    doc: Optional dataset containing possible values in the parent data that represent

- neurodata_type_def: MeaningsTable
  neurodata_type_inc: DynamicTable
  doc: A table to store information about the meanings of categorical data. Intended
    to be used as a lookup table for the meanings of values in a CategoricalVectorData
    object. All possible values of the parent CategoricalVectorData object should
    be present in the 'value' column of this table, even if the value is not observed
    in the data. Additional columns may be added to store additional metadata about
    each value.

    doc: The value of the parent CategoricalVectorData object.

- neurodata_type_def: EventsTable
  neurodata_type_inc: DynamicTable
  doc: A column-based table to store information about events (event instances), one
    event per row. Additional columns may be added to store metadata about each event,
    such as the duration of the event.
  attributes:
  - name: description
    dtype: text
    doc: A description of the events stored in the table, including information about
      how the event times were computed, especially if the times are the result of
      processing or filtering raw data. For example, if the experimenter is encoding
      different types of events using a strobed or N-bit encoding, then the description
      should describe which channels were used and how the event time is computed,
      e.g., as the rise time of the first bit.
  datasets:
  - name: timestamp
    neurodata_type_inc: TimestampVectorData
    doc: Column containing the time that each event occurred, in seconds, from the
      session start time.
  - name: duration
    neurodata_type_inc: DurationVectorData
    doc: Optional column containing the duration of each event, in seconds. A value
      of NaN can be used for events without a duration or with a duration that is
      not yet specified.
