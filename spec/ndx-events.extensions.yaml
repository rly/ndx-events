  doc: "Event timestamps that can have different labels and other metadata. For example,\
    \ this type could represent the times that reward was given, as well as which\
    \ of three different types of reward was given. In this case, the 'data' dataset\
    \ would contain unique values {0, 1, 2}, and the 'labels' table would contain\
    \ three rows, one for each unique data value, and two columns: 'label', which\
    \ stores a unique name for each event type, and a custom column 'reward_type',\
    \ which stores information about the type of reward given. The values in row with\
    \ index i would represent the reward associated with a data value of i. For example,\
    \ 'timestamps' may contain values [0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.2], 'data' may contain values\
    \ [0, 1, 0, 2], and the 'labels' table may contain three rows, where the row at\
    \ index 0 has label='Users may specify custom columns in the 'labels' table to\
    \ store arbitrary metadata associated with each event type. The values in the\
    \ 'data' dataset do not have to be continuous and start at 0, but this is recommended\
    \ so that there are not empty rows in the 'labels' table."
