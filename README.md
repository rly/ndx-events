# ndx-events Extension for NWB

This is an NWB extension for storing timestamped event data and TTL pulses.

The latest version is 0.3.0. This is a major change from previous versions.

Events can be:
1. **Simple events**. These are stored in the `Events` type. The `Events` type consists of only a name, a description,
and a 1D array of timestamps. This should be used instead of a `TimeSeries` when the time series has no data.
2. **Labeled events**. These are stored in the `LabeledEvents` type. The `LabeledEvents` type expands on the `Events`
type by adding 1) a 1D array of integer values (data) with the same length as the timestamps and 2) a 1D array of
labels (labels) associated with each unique integer value in the data array. The data values are indices into the
array of labels. The `LabeledEvents` type can be used to encode additional information about individual events,
such as the reward values for each reward event.
3. **TTL pulses**. These are stored in the `TTLs` type. The `TTLs` type is a subtype of the `LabeledEvents` type
specifically for TTL pulse data. A single instance should be used for all TTL pulse data. The pulse value (or channel)
should be stored in the 1D data array, and the labels associated with each pulse value (or channel)
should be stored in the 1D array of labels.
4. **Annotated events**. These are stored in the `AnnotatedEventsTable` type. The `AnnotatedEventsTable` type is a
subtype of `DynamicTable`, where each row corresponds to a different event type. The table has a ragged
(variable-length) 1D column of event times, such that each event type (row) is associated with an array of event times.
Unlike for the other event types, users can add their own custom columns to annotate each event type or event time.
This can be useful for storing event metadata related to data preprocessing and analysis, such as marking bad events.

This extension was developed by Ryan Ly, Ben Dichter, Oliver RÃ¼bel, and Andrew Tritt. Information about the rationale,
background, and alternative approaches to this extension can be found here:

## Installation
Python:
```bash
pip install -U ndx-events
```

Matlab:
```matlab
generateExtension('<directory path>/ndx-events/spec/ndx-events.namespace.yaml');
```

## Example usage
Python:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from ndx_events import Events, EventsTable, EventTypesTable
from pynwb import NWBFile, NWBHDF5IO

nwb = NWBFile(
    session_description="session description",
    identifier="cool_experiment_001",
    session_start_time=datetime.now().astimezone(),
)

# create a basic events object
basic_tone_event = Events(
    name="tone_onset",
    timestamps=[0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6],
    description="Times when a tone was played.",
)

# add the basic events object to the NWBFile object
nwb.add_acquisition(basic_tone_event)

# create an event types table
event_types_table = EventTypesTable(
    name="EventTypesTable",
    description="metadata about event types",
)

# create a new custom column with additional metadata
event_types_table.add_column(
    name="extra_metadata",
    description="some additional metadata about each event type",
)

# add event types one by one
event_types_table.add_row(
    id=0, event_name="trial start", extra_metadata="more metadata"
)
event_types_table.add_row(
    id=1, event_name="cue onset", extra_metadata="more metadata"
)
event_types_table.add_row(
    id=2, event_name="cue offset", extra_metadata="more metadata"
)
event_types_table.add_row(
    id=3, event_name="nosepoke left", extra_metadata="more metadata"
)
event_types_table.add_row(
    id=4, event_name="nosepoke right", extra_metadata="more metadata"
)
event_types_table.add_row(id=5, event_name="reward", extra_metadata="more metadata")

# add the event types table to the acquisition group for now
# it should be added to the /general/tasks group when merged with core
nwb.add_acquisition(event_types_table)

# create a new EventsTable type to hold events recorded from the data acquisition system
events_table = EventsTable(
    name="EventsTable",
    description="events from my experiment",
)
# set the dynamic table region link
events_table["event_type"].table = event_types_table

# add events one by one
events_table.add_row(timestamp=0.1, event_type=0, duration=0.0)
events_table.add_row(timestamp=0.3, event_type=1, duration=0.0)
events_table.add_row(timestamp=0.4, event_type=2, duration=0.0)
events_table.add_row(timestamp=0.8, event_type=4, duration=0.1)
events_table.add_row(timestamp=0.85, event_type=5, duration=0.0)

# add the EventsTable type to the acquisition group of the NWB file
nwb.add_acquisition(events_table)

# write nwb file
filename = "test.nwb"
with NWBHDF5IO(filename, "w") as io:
    io.write(nwb)

# read nwb file and check its contents
with NWBHDF5IO(filename, "r", load_namespaces=True) as io:
    nwb = io.read()
    print(nwb)
    # access the events table and event types table by name from the NWBFile acquisition group and print it
    print(nwb.acquisition["tone_onset"])
    print(nwb.acquisition["EventTypesTable"])
    print(nwb.acquisition["EventsTable"])
    print(nwb.acquisition["EventsTable"].to_dataframe())
    print(nwb.acquisition["EventsTable"][0, "event_type"])
```

This extension was created using [ndx-template](https://github.com/nwb-extensions/ndx-template).
